Welcome to the Face Recognition System with Eye Blink Detection repository! This project is designed to recognize faces in video streams while simultaneously detecting whether the detected faces have their eyes open or closed. It leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to achieve accurate face recognition and eye blink detection.

Features

• Accurate face detection in video streams.

• Real-time eye blink detection for each detected face.

• Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for robust performance.

• Offers an easy-to-use API for integration into your own projects.

• Highly customizable for various use cases.
